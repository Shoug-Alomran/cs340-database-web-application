# Phase 1 – Application Concept

## Application Purpose and Scope
Sillah is a preventive family health management system designed to support Saudi families with hereditary health issues, including cardiac and other hereditary diseases. The system enables users to record family health histories, generate automated hereditary risk warnings, and schedule preventive clinic visits.

The purpose of the application is to raise preventive health awareness, simplify family health management, and support early risk detection through data analysis.

The application manages user data, family members, health events, risk warnings, clinic information, appointments, and health awareness content using a relational database management system. Integration with real hospital systems, real-time medical diagnoses, and live data exchange with healthcare providers are outside the scope of this project. The system is intended solely for educational and preventive purposes and does not provide medical diagnoses or treatments.

## Target Users and Usage Scenarios
Sillah’s target audience includes:
- Citizens / families (primary users)
- Healthcare providers
- Administrators

Example usage scenarios:
- Users input family medical history and receive alerts if hereditary risks are detected.
- Users can input a specific condition and age of onset to improve tracking and analysis.
