# Phase 0 – Project Idea

## Application Name
**Sillah (صلة) – Preventive Family Health Management System**

## Problem Statement
Many families with hereditary health conditions lack a centralized and organized way to track family medical history, identify potential hereditary risks early, and take preventive action. Health data is often scattered, undocumented, or difficult to analyze over time. This makes early detection and preventive planning challenging, especially for hereditary diseases that depend on family-wide patterns rather than individual symptoms.

## Target Users
- **Families / Citizens:** Primary users who record family members, medical histories, and receive preventive risk alerts.
- **Healthcare Providers:** View summarized, user-shared preventive data to support awareness and screening recommendations.
- **System Administrators:** Manage clinics, awareness content, and monitor system data integrity.

## Core Features (Initial)
- Record and manage family members and their medical histories.
- Detect and generate alerts for potential hereditary health risks based on stored data.
- Schedule and manage preventive clinic appointments.
- Provide educational awareness content related to preventive health.

## Data the System Must Store
- **User Data:** User identity, contact information, role, and authentication details.
- **Family Member Data:** Family relationships, demographic information, and linkage to users.
- **Medical History Data:** Health conditions, age of onset, severity, and associated family members.
- **Risk Alert Data:** Generated alerts, detection dates, descriptions, and status.
- **Appointment Data:** Clinic details, appointment dates, booking status, and confirmations.
- **Awareness Content Data:** Educational articles, preventive tips, and health guidance.
