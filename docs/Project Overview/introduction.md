# Introduction

## Purpose
This project is a full-stack, database-driven web application developed for **CS 340 – Introduction to Database Systems**.

## Goals
- Design a relational database from concept to implementation
- Enforce integrity constraints (keys, entity integrity, referential integrity)
- Execute SQL queries through backend code
- Deliver a functional web application with CRUD operations

## Target Outcome
A complete system where users can create, view, update, and delete data through a web interface, backed by a relational database.

## Collaboration Tools and Workflow
- GitHub & Documentation Website: version control for documentation and code, and structured access to project phases
- WhatsApp Group: coordination and quick clarifications
- Google Docs: collaborative drafting and review

## Coordination and Review
- Phase-based task distribution
- Internal review before submission for correctness, consistency, and completeness
