# CS 340 – Full-Stack Database Web Application

## Project Overview
This project is a **full-stack, database-driven web application** developed as part of the  
**CS 340 – Introduction to Database Systems** course.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how **relational databases are designed, implemented, and integrated into real software systems**, rather than focusing on database design in isolation.

The application includes:
- A user-facing web interface  
- A backend layer implementing application logic  
- A relational database for persistent storage  
- SQL queries executed through backend code  

---

## Project Objectives
- Design a complete relational database starting from conceptual modeling (EER)
- Translate the conceptual model into a logical relational schema
- Implement the database using SQL with integrity constraints
- Integrate SQL queries into backend application code
- Build a working web application that supports CRUD operations
- Demonstrate both basic and advanced SQL queries through the application

---

## Technologies Used
*(To be finalized as the project progresses)*

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** (e.g., Python / Java / Node.js)  
- **Database:** (e.g., MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)  

---

## Project Structure
The project follows the phased structure defined in the CS 340 project specification:

- **Phase 0:** Team formation and project proposal  
- **Phase 1:** Application concept and system planning  
- **Phase 2:** Conceptual data modeling (EER)  
- **Phase 3:** Logical database design  
- **Phase 4:** Database implementation (SQL)  
- **Phase 5:** Full-stack application development  

Each phase builds cumulatively on the previous ones.

---

## Team Members
- **Shoug Alomran**  
- **Yara Albugami**  
- **Rose Al Rakan**

Each team member contributes to both the **design** and **implementation** aspects of the project, including database modeling, SQL development, and application features.

---

## Notes
- All SQL queries are executed through the application backend.
- The project adheres to academic integrity guidelines.
- Each team member is able to explain and justify their individual contributions.
